I used the Google Maps Api to point to the school I go to and where I am from.
I used this in my about me section because it seemed most relevant. I do not have
an API key as it required a credit card so the use is limited and for now even with
the right Latitude/Longitude coordinates, I cannot have the map center on UCSD.
